To access this you just need to 
1. go to the GCP and turn the vision api and vertexai api and download the json file containing secret file(store and handle it carefully) and copy the project id and paste it somewhere to have a quick access
2. create a python environment and run the requirements text file through cmd, so it will install all the required dependencies then store the json secert key file inm the same folder to have the proper access and although i have given the testing video but you can use your in that place 
3. now open ask_gemini.py file and paste you project_id whereever required 

4. now run the main.py file with giving video file name and it will create a CSV file with the metadata then run ask_gemini.py and it will generate the overview of  video, with the trends of emotions and activites. 


happy code
